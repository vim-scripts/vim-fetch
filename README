vim-fetch enables Vim to process line and column jump specifications in file paths as found in stack traces and similar output. When asked to open such a file, Vim with vim-fetch will jump to the specified line (and column, if given) instead of displaying an empty, new file.

If you have wished Vim would understand stack trace formats, vim-fetch is for you.
