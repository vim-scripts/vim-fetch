" Based on |BufWinEnter| to correctly process all buffers in the initial
" |arglist| (see |windows-starting| for some background, though that omits to
" mention that |BufRead| events are also skipped, as is |BufNewFile|, that
" |BufWinEnter| events *are* fired for all buffers, and relies on implicit
" understanding that the first buffer of the list is activated after loading,
" thus triggering all relevant events; also note there is no equivalent help
" section for '-p' though its behaviour is analogous).
"
" The extra |WinEnter| and |TabEnter| events are needed to correctly process
" the first file in an |arglist| passed with '-o/-O' resp. '-p'; without them,
" the first buffer is correctly loaded, but its window still displays the
" spec'ed version of the file  (go figure; no, I'm not sure I want to know).
"
" Note the use of spec specific file name patterns to avoid autocommand
" flooding when nesting.
